If you have a lawyer, then the lawyer will present your oral argument. You can go to court for oral argument but you are not required to go if you are represented by a lawyer.\n \n Can I get a transcript of what was said in the oral argument for my case? All oral arguments in the Court of Appeal are electronically recorded. Any party may pay a fee to get a copy of the oral argument recording from the Court of Appeal. If you want a written transcript of the recording, you will need to contact a transcription service and pay them a separate fee.\n \n What does the court think if I do not make an oral argument? If you decide not to make an oral argument, the court will not think that you are not interested or that you don\u2019t care about the appeal. You do not give up or weaken any arguments in your brief. The court will not think differently or badly about you or your arguments. If you do not make an oral argument, it will not negatively impact the way the court decides an appeal.\n \n How will the court decide if there are no oral arguments? If all the parties waive oral argument \u2013 meaning no parties talk to the justices in person \u2013 then the Court of Appeal will decide your appeal based on the briefs, the law, and the record on appeal.\n \n What does it mean if the court sends me a notice saying they don\u2019t need oral argument? Sometimes the Court of Appeal will send notice to the parties saying the court is prepared to issue a decision without oral argument. This is not a sign that the court will decide either for or against the appeal.\nEven though the court says oral argument is not necessary, you can still request oral argument. You would need to give the court notice in writing and tell them you want to make an oral argument.

The appellate court can only reverse the trial court's decision if it finds a legal mistake in the trial court proceedings that was so important that it changed at least part of the outcome of the case. Because of this heavy burden on the appellant to prove this type of mistake, it is quite difficult to win an appeal.\nFiling an appeal does not stop the trial court's order\nUnless you ask the trial or appellate court to postpone (\"stay\") the trial court's order, you must do what the trial court's order requires you to do during the appeal. A request for a stay can be complicated, and you may still have to pay some of the money ordered by the trial court upfront. Ask a lawyer if one of these options would be good in your case and get help.

Most appeals are limited to a review of the record from the lower court. Parties cannot introduce new \r\n evidence, but are limited to what was said and introduced at the original trial. The appellate court reviews the lower court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s application of the law to the facts as presented \r\n at the trial.\nSome appeals do allow for a new trial without reference to the evidence submitted in the original proceeding. Such an appeal results in a trial de novo, meaning a trial \r\n from the beginning. Appeals from small claims court result in a trial de novo in the Superior court. The superior court judge is not bound by the decision of the small claims \r\n judge, and new evidence can be presented.\n\nInformation on Appeal Types\n\nSmall Claims Appeals\n\nAppeal after being present at trial\nIn small claims court an appeal results in a trial de novo, meaning a trial from the beginning, conducted in the Superior Court. Therefore, all evidence presented at the \r\n small claims trial must be presented again in the Superior Court at the trial de novo. Only a Superior Court judge will hear a trial de novo; no pro tem or temporary judge \r\n hears small claims appeals.\r\n\r\n Only the defendant, or a plaintiff who was counter sued as a cross-defendant and lost on the cross-complaint, can appeal a small claims case. A plaintiff cannot file an \r\n appeal. The defendant or cross-defendant must have been present at the time of trial in order to appeal the decision.\nAny of the parties may choose to have an attorney represent him, her or it at the trial de novo. Unlike in regular superior court cases, an attorney is not required to \r\n represent a corporation at a trial de novo.", "title": "The Superior Court of California - County of Ventura - Appeals"}, {"document_id": "99a3a0f6df5d4890-1523-3601", "text": "Court Opinion \u2013 California Appellate Courts\nsend the case back to the trial court for a new trial or hearing\ndismiss the appeal if it was not filed on time, if there is not an appealable order, or if there is a procedural default (like failure to file a brief or pay a fee)\n\nThe court\u2019s opinion generally also includes information about who may be eligible to have their appeal fees paid by the other party.\nHow the Court Makes a Decision\nThere are three justices at every Court of Appeal. A majority of the justices \u2013 or two of the three justices \u2013 must agree on a decision.\nWhat\u2019s in the Written Decision\nRegardless of what the Court of Appeal justices decide, they issue an order or opinion in writing. Generally, the court justices must provide an opinion with reasons why they made the decision. The court justices are not required to provide an opinion if they issue an order dismissing the appeal.\nMost often there is one written statement signed by all of the justices. Sometimes a justice will file an additional opinion. This can either be a concurrence (written by a justice who agrees with the decision) or a dissent (written by a justice who does not agree with the decision).\nHow the Court Notifies the Parties\nWhen the Court of Appeal makes a decision, the court clerk sends notice of the court\u2019s opinion or order to all parties in the case. If a party does not have a lawyer, the court sends notice to the party. If a party has a lawyer, the court sends notice to their lawyer.\nAsking for Reimbursement of Court Costs\nThe Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion usually awards costs on appeal.\nIn most cases, a party who wins an appeal can ask the other party to pay for their court costs. In some cases, a party who wins may also be able to ask the other party to pay for their attorney fees.\nAfter the court issues a remittitur (the final step in an appeal), the winning party can file a memorandum of costs in the trial court.

First, paying down your loan early will save you lots in interest, no brainer. Second, keeping the account open will improve your credit score by 1) increases the number of installment trade lines you have open, 2)adds to your positive payment history and 3) varies your credit mix. If your paid your car off you will see a DROP in your credit score because now you have one less trade line. To address other issues as far as credit scoring, it does not matter(much) for your score if you have a $1000 car loan or a $100,000 car loan. what matters is whether or not you pay on time, and what your balance is compared to the original loan amount. So the quicker you pay DOWN the loans or mortgages the better. Pay them down, not off! As far how the extra payments will report, one of two things will happen. Either they will report every month paid as agreed (most likely), or they wont report anything for a few years until your next payment is due(unlikely, this wont hurt you but wont help you either). Someone posted they would lower the amount you paid every month on your report and thus lower your score. This is not true. even if they reported you paid $1/ month the scoring calculations do not care. All they care is whether or not you're on time, and in your case you would be months AHEAD of time(even though your report cant reflect this fact either) HOWEVER, if you are applying for a mortgage the lower monthly payment WOULD affect you in the sense that now you qualify for a BIGGER loan because now your debt to income ratio has improved. People will argue to just pay it off and be debt free, however being debt free does NOT help your credit. And being that you own a home and a car you see the benefits of good credit. You can have a million dollars in the bank but you will be denied a loan if you have NO or bad credit.

Credit history is based on the average age of all of your accounts, cards or otherwise, the older the better. Don't close either of your other cards (because that would cause your average account age to fall), and make sure to use the store card at least occasionally, because lenders sometimes decide to close unused lines of credit. Credit mix has to do with the different types of credit you hold and is why your bank's website suggested taking out a loan.

You wouldn't want to get several new ones at the same time because... New credit is affected by the credit inquiries (hard pulls) that occur when you apply for new cards or loans.

That's because for the most part, when you get a credit score for free, you're not getting a true FICO score.  You're getting instead a VantageScore. VantageScore was created by the three credit bureaus, and as such they can offer it without paying Fair Isaac a licensing fee.  That makes it a lot cheaper to offer, and while it's not absolutely identical to FICO (or more accurately to any of the FICO provided scores) it's close enough for most peoples' purpose. And of course undoubtedly Fair Isaac has some price pressure on their side now that Vantage is big enough that many people see them as fungible.  As such they've had to make it easier, or they'd lose business - no longer being a monopolist. The other relevant piece here is that probably in many of these cases they're really just offering you what Experian would give you directly - so it's just a cross-marketing thing (where Experian, or perhaps another bureau, gets access to you as a customer so they can up-sell you ID theft insurance and whatnot, while the bank gets to offer the free score)."}, {"document_id": "132743-0-2056", "text": "\n\"The major bureaus use the Fair Isaac scoring model, for the most part. Here's an excerpt from a web site (Versions of the FICO scoring model) to explain: One of the first things a newcomer to this board learns is the difference between FICO and FAKO scores. FAKO refers to the non-FICO scores offered by various companies. FAKO scores have little value since few of them are used by lenders and they do not match closely to FICO scores. But even when you stick with FICO scores, confusion can ensue because FICO scores have many different editions, versions, and variations. On a single day, a consumer could theoretically have dozens of different FICO scores, depending on which version and credit agency is used to produce the score. This post provides a summary of the various FICO versions. Please offer any corrections or updates, and they will be edited in. The FICO scoring model with its familiar range of 300 to 850 was first introduced in 1989. Since then, FICO has released five major revisions: 1995, 1998, 2004, 2008, and 2014. Each \"\"edition\"\" uses a different formula and produces a different score. When a new FICO edition is released, many lenders continue using an older version for years before \"\"upgrading.\"\" The 1995 revision is no longer in common use, but later editions are still used by lenders. Most FICO editions are commonly known by the year of introduction: FICO 98, FICO 04, and FICO 08 (although FICO now calls it FICO Score 8, without the zero). The most recent edition is FICO Score 9 introduced in 2014. As of 2014, FICO Score 8 is the most commonly used. However, most mortgage lenders use FICO 04 for Equifax and Transunion, and FICO 98 for Experian. In addition to the \"\"classic\"\" version, FICO offers \"\"Industry Option\"\" versions customized for auto loans, credit cards, installment loans, personal finance loans, and insurance. These have a score range of 250 to 900, so the scores are not fully comparable with \"\"classic\"\" versions.

Barclays US/ Juniper Bank credit cards offer a free Transunion \"\"TransRisk\"\"(TM) score. The TransRisk score is a 900 point scale, while the FICO score is an 850 point scale.

Equifax Credit Score, like FICO, Vantagescore, and others, is based on a proprietary formula that is not publicly available.  Every score is calculated with a different formula, and can vary from each other widely.  Lenders almost exclusively only use FICO scores, so the score number you have is likely different than the score lenders will use. Second, understand that the advice you see from places like Mint and Credit Karma will almost always tell you that you don't have enough credit card accounts.  The reason for this is that they make their money by referring customers to credit card applications.  They have a financial interest in telling you that you need more credit cards. Finally, realize that credit score is just a number, and is only useful for a limited number of things.  Higher is better to a point, and after that, you get no benefit from increasing your score.   My advice to you is this: Don't stress out about your credit score, especially a free score reported by Credit Karma or Mint.  If you really have a desire to find out your score, you can pay FICO to get your actual score, but it's not cheap.  You can also sometimes get your FICO score by applying for a loan and asking the lender.  I last saw my FICO scores (there were three, one from each credit bureau) when I applied for a mortgage a couple of years ago, and the mortgage rep gave them to me for free.  But honestly, knowing your score doesn't do much for you, as the best way to increase it is to simply make your payments on time and wait. Don't give in to bad conventional advice from places that are funded by the financial services industry.  The thing that makes your credit score go up is a long history of paying your bills on time.  Despite what you commonly read about credit scores, I'm not convinced that you can radically boost your scores by having lots of open credit card accounts.  At the time I applied for my last mortgage, I only had 2 open credit cards (still true), and the oldest open account was about 1.5 years old.  The average of my 3 scores was just over 800.

When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched.

For information about use cases for relevancy training, see [Improve your natural language query results from Watson Discovery](https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/improving-your-natural-language-query-results-from-watson-discovery/).\n\nTo train Watson, you must provide the following:\n\n\n\n* Example queries that are representative of the queries your users enter\n* Ratings that indicate which results for each query are relevant and not relevant\n\n\n\nAfter Watson has enough training input, the information that you provide about which results are good and bad for each query is used to learn about your collection. Watson does not just memorize, but it also learns from the specific information about individual queries and applies the patterns it detects to all new queries. It does so, using machine-learning Watson techniques that find signals in your content and questions.

When synonyms are defined, the customer does not need to submit an exact phrase or keyword that your project is trained to understand. Even variations of the term are recognized and used to find the best results. For example, you can expand a query for ibm to include international business machines and big blue. Query expansion terms are typically synonyms, antonyms, or common misspellings for terms.\n\nSynonyms that you add to improve the search results function differently from synonyms that you add to a dictionary. Dictionary synonyms are recognized and tagged at the time that a document is ingested. The synonyms that you define are recognized and tagged as occurrences of the associated dictionary term, so that they can be retrieved later by search.

This action means making requests of many individual database servers. The API coordination node receives the responses from all these servers and combines them to form a single response to the client. This response might involve buffering data and delaying the response to the client if, for example, data requires sorting.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partition querying \n\nYou can make partition queries to the following index types:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant Query\n* Views\n* Search\n\n\n\nWhen you make a partition query, the database can query just the data within a single partition. A partition's data resides in just one shard (with three replicas). The API coordination node can make a request directly to servers that host that data rather than needing to combine responses from many servers. The API coordination node is also free from buffering the response since it has no combination step to carry out. As a result, the data arrives at the client more quickly.\n\nAs the size of a database increases, the number of shards must also increase. The increase in shards directly increases the number of queries that the API coordination node needs to make to servers that host data when you use global queries. However, when you use partition queries, the number of shards has no effect on the number of servers the API coordination node needs to contact. As this number stays small, increasing data size has no effect on query latency, unlike global queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Partitioned databases tutorials \n\nYou can see two examples of using partitioned databases:\n\n\n\n1.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\","}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00491-1283-3050", "text": "\n(Optional) [Create an acurl alias](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-working-with-curlencode-user-name-and-password).\n\n\n\nIf you decide not to set up acurl, use the following URL with curl instead of the one provided in the exercises, curl \"https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/databasedemo\".\n\nThe acurl alias is more secure. It prevents someone from reading your password over your shoulder as you type. It also makes sure that your password isn\u2019t sent in plain text over the network by enforcing HTTPS.\n\nNow, we're ready to learn how to run queries against the database you created in step two of [Before you begin](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-querybefore-you-begin-qt).\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 1: Creating an index \n\nIBM Cloudant Query uses Mongo-style query syntax to search for documents by using logical operators. IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00491-3787-5406", "text": "\nStep 2: Running a simple query \n\nThis example demonstrates how IBM Cloudant Query finds documents based on the descriptionField with the value boiling.\n\nTo run the query, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON into a data file named query1.json:\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": \"boiling\"\n}\n}\n2. Run the following command to query the database:\n\nacurl \"https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/databasedemo/_find\" -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d @query1.json\n3.

The fields parameter specifies the fields to include with the results.

The results include the descriptionField and temperatureField, shown in descending order by temperature.\n\nYou use a selector expression like the following example:\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"temperatureField\": {\n\"$gt\": 50\n},\n\"descriptionField\": {\n\"$eq\": \"hot\"\n}\n},\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"sort\": [{\n\"temperatureField\": \"desc\"\n}],\n\"use_index\": \"_design/query-demo-index\"\n}\nShow more\n\nTo run the query, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.

She did not appear to be angered at this . After an awkward silence , Toby announces his move to Costa Rica . In `` Goodbye , Toby '' Pam gives to Toby an office picture of the staff that excludes her ( because she took the picture herself ) for when he leaves for Costa Rica . Toby , unsatisfied by the lack of her presence , shouts at the office staff asking for a camera ( possibly the loudest he 's ever spoken ) . When no one responds , he runs off for an extended amount of time just to find a camera to have a picture of her and him together . Pam also helps Toby take revenge against Michael in this episode after his insulting farewell gift is exposed during a meeting and she gets him to unwillingly give up his watch to Toby , which he does ( Pam potentially may have disclosed Michael 's abuse of Toby if he did n't do what she said ) . At the end of the episode , Pam comments ( though not to Toby ) that she always thought he was kind of cute and that she will miss him a lot . In `` Niagara '' Toby appears to still have feelings for Pam and is happy when they run out on their wedding . He is later disappointed when the wedding is called back on but is seen smiling and clapping after they 're married and run down the aisle . During `` Roy 's Wedding '' , while Jim and Pam are trying to find out if there 's anything they do n't know about each other , Toby correctly answers facts about Pam . Everyone notices him , and Toby , clearly embarrassed , attempts to cover it up . There have been a few occasions when Pam has mistreated Toby somewhat such as hanging up on him on the phone after Toby offered his help and notably in `` Paper Airplane '' after hitting him in the eye with a paper airplane and getting angry at him for crossing ( to which Toby apologizes ) . Pam in response does not apologize and simply asks whether she is still in the contest despite injuring and temporally blinding Toby . In the series finale , while dancing with Pam , Toby began sobbing . Pam questions Toby with `` Is it me ? Is it Nellie ? '' Toby shakes his head , and responds with `` It 's everything .

This can be done for several reasons; usually the primary reason is that the terms of the new loan will result in a lower monthly payment. Debt consolidation (taking out one big loan at a relatively low interest rate to pay off the smaller, higher-interest loans that rack up, like credit card debt, medical bills, etc) is a form of refinancing, but you most commonly hear the term when referring to refinancing a home mortgage, as in your example. To answer your questions, most of the money comes from a new bank. That bank understands up front that this is a re-fi and not \"\"new debt\"\"; the homeowner isn't asking for any additional money, but instead the money they get will pay off outstanding debt. Therefore, the net amount of outstanding debt remains roughly equal. Even then, a re-fi can be difficult for a homeowner to get (at least on terms he'd be willing to take). First off, if the homeowner owes more than the home's worth, a re-fi may not cover the full principal of the existing loan. The bank may reject the homeowner outright as not creditworthy (a new house is a HUGE ding on your credit score, trust me), or the market and the homeowner's credit may prevent the bank offering loan terms that are worth it to the homeowner. The homeowner must often pony up cash up front for the closing costs of this new mortgage, which is money the homeowner hopes to recoup in reduced interest; however, the homeowner may not recover all the closing costs for many years, or ever. To answer the question of why a bank would do this, there are several reasons: The bank offering the re-fi is usually not the bank getting payments for the current mortgage. This new bank wants to take your business away from your current bank, and receive the substantial amount of interest involved over the remaining life of the loan."}, {"document_id": "274870-0-1888", "text": "\n\"Mortgage is a (secured) debt, a combination of a promissory note, and a security interest providing the mortage holder a secured interest in the property.

But that depends upon whether you define the term \"\"in debt\"\" as a debt appearing on the balance sheet, or the net of assets - liabilities is less than zero, whether you have a \"\"debt\"\" expense on the income statement (budget), or whether the net of income - expenses is less than zero. One person might look at their budget, find the (monthly) mortgage payment listed, and judge that they have a debt payment, and thus are \"\"in debt\"\". Or they might look at their expenses, find they exceed their income, and judge that they are \"\"in debt\"\". Another person might look at their balance sheet, compare assets to liabilities, and only say they were \"\"in debt\"\" when their liabilities exceeded their assets. Some people view mortgage debt as \"\"good debt\"\", as they view certain debts as \"\"good\"\" and others as \"\"bad\"\". Trust me, having a high mortgage payment (higher 30% of your net income) is hard, and over 40% is bad. Consider you balance sheet and your income statement. On your balance sheet, the house appears on the \"\"asset\"\" side with an (estimated) value, while the \"\"mortgage\"\" (really, the promissory note part of the mortgage) appears on the \"\"liability\"\" side. On your income statement, your house does not appear on the income side, but the mortgage (promissory note) payment appears on the expense side.

As long as you sell the house on your own, for more than you owe, most of the time in the US you will get about 92-94% of the sale price back, minus whatever you owe on the house. The 6-8% you don't get will go to the realtors as commission (unless you sell by owner and don't sell to someone with a buyer's agent), and to pay some of the costs of the sale (how much of those you pay depends on the deal you make with the buyer, but it's common to pay some of them in some areas). You also will owe taxes (potentially). You then pay the bank back from that amount. As such, in your example, let's say Bob owes $50k on his house, and sells it with a realtor for $150k. He gets $150k-0.06*150k = 141k after commission. He then hands the bank a check for the current payoff of the loan: that amount is usually slightly higher than the remaining principal, because you owe the interest that's accrued between [last payment you made] and [day of sale]. Let's say this is a 6% loan, which works out to around 0.5% per month, and it's been half a month since his last payment, so he owes another 0.25%, or another $125. Some mortgages also may have prepayment penalties (check your note). In this case there isn't a penalty, so the bank gets $50,125 from the sale. Usually, the bank would get that immediately at closing - ie, he doesn't get the full $141k or $150k and then write a check, instead the title/closing company gets that amount, and gives the $9k to the realtors, the $50,125 to the bank, and the remaining $90,875 to him."}, {"document_id": "447580-0-742", "text": "\n\"The typical down-payment was expected to be 20%.

There is an element of not wanting to shell out another 20 million if the place burns down, or someone breaks in and steals your valuables, but the bigger part of the reason is that it's required to get a mortgage in the first place, which is generally done for financial reasons - interest on your mortgage is a tax deduction, and you don't want to sink millions of dollars all at once into buying a property that's not going to appreciate in value, when you can get a mortgage and invest those millions of dollars to make more money instead.\""}, {"document_id": "430612-0-1543", "text": "\n(Disclosure - I am a real estate agent, involved with houses to buy/sell, but much activity in rentals) I got a call from a man and his wife looking for an apartment.

He didn't have enough savings to rebuild, and besides needing an apartment, had a building lot to sell.  Insurance against theft may not be at the top of your list. Don't keep any cash, and keep your possessions to a minimum. But a house needs insurance for a bank to give you a mortgage. Once paid off, you have no legal obligation, but are playing a dangerous game. You are right, it's an odds game. If the cost of insurance is .5% the house value and the chance of it burning down is 1 in 300 (I made this up) you are simply betting it won't be yours that burns down.  Given that for most people, a paid off house is their largest asset, more value that all other savings combined, it's a risk most would prefer not to take.  Life insurance is a different matter. A person with no dependents has no need for insurance. For those who are married (or have a loved one), or for parents, insurance is intended to help survivors bridge the gap for that lost income.

A second point is, if possible, to buy when the mortgage interest rates are low, and then go for a mortgage with fixed interest and fixed repayments. While such a mortgage will be more more expensive than one with variable interest, and house prices are higher when mortgage rates are lower, future inflation is almost a certainty. And if your interest rate was fixed, and you are confident that you'll be able to negotiate salary raises in pace with the inflation, then inflation will gradually whittle down the rate between the mortgage payment and your income. Conversely, if interest rates are historically high, with no lowering in sight, then a variable loan might be more interesting.

If you have the financial ability to assume the risk of owning, you may be better off.  I would consider two things.  Renting is purchasing a service. You are buying the flexibility to move with minimum hassle and the landlord is assuming the risk of owning the asset (property). They will make money on you, like any service provider. Buying is purchasing an asset. You are buying the underlying asset and assume all the risks associated with it. This is large, unforeseen maintenance, fees, taxes, depreciation, etc... Some of these risks were passed to you as a renter, but some were not.  Just like purchasing $400k in stock, if you have to sell when the market is down, you lose big. You win if you can hold. Unlike a stock, real estate will eat your cash in taxes and repairs unless it is rented. If you are willing to be a long-distance landlord, this may work out. Understand that property management fees will eat into your rent income and being long-distance will give more potential for a bad tenant to ruin your property value. These and other factors (e.g. vacancy rate) will increase your risk of loss and should be considered. Some of this will be your preference, since you will spend much more time dealing with buying/selling/property management as opposed to a more clean rental situation.

When you buy, assuming you don't have the cash to buy outright but get a mortgage, some of the payment goes to interest, but you are building equity. Ultimately you pay off the mortgage and you can then live rent-free. When you buy, you can alter your home to your liking. You can paint in the colors you like, put in the carpet or flooring you like, heck, tear down walls and alter the floor plan (subject to building codes and safety consideration, of course). If you rent, you are usually sharply limited in what alterations you can make. In the U.S., mortgage interest is tax deductible. Rent is not. Property taxes are deductible from your federal income tax. So if you have, say, $1000 mortgage vs $1000 rent, the mortgage is actually cheaper. Advantages of renting: There are a lot of transaction costs involved in buying a house. You have to pay a realtor's commission, various legal fees, usually \"\"loan origination fees\"\" to the bank, etc. Plus the way mortgages are designed, your total payment is the same throughout the life of the loan. But for the first payment you owe interest on the total balance of the loan, while the last payment you only owe interest on a small amount. So early payments are mostly interest. This leads to the conventional advice that you should not buy unless you plan to live in the house for some reasonably long period of time, exact amount varying with whose giving the advice, but I think 3 to 5 years is common. One mitigating factor: Bear in mind that if you buy a house, and then after 2 years sell it, and you discover that the sale price minus purchase price minus closing costs ends up a net minus, say, $20,000, it's not entirely fair to say \"\"zounds! I lost $20,000 by buying\"\". If you had not bought this house, presumably you would have been renting. So the fair comparison is, mortgage payments plus losses on the resale compared to likely rental payments for the same period.\""}, {"document_id": "206794-0-2218", "text": "\n\"A home is an investment, but the value it returns isn't primarily financial ($$) - they are consumption (a place to live). This gives it different characteristics than other investments (e.g. increasing the amount invested by buying a more expensive home doesn't do much to assist your financial well-being and future income, and isn't necessarily the \"\"responsible\"\" thing to do). You may get some capital gains, typically in line with inflation, sometimes less, sometimes more, but those aren't the most reliable, and it's difficult to realize them (it involves selling your house and moving). Its main value as a hedge is a hedge against rising rent. But if you're still working full-time and can expect cost-of-living increases, that hedge may not be as valuable to you as it would to, say, someone living on a fixed income. But as for treating it as a \"\"low-risk investment\"\"? That's very problematic. Real low-risk investments are things like government bonds, where you can't lose principal. Unless you're going to live into your house until the day you die, the real estate crash should have disabused you of any notion that housing values never go down. Rather, your house is a single, indivisible, undiversified, illiquid investment. Imagine, if you will, going to your brokerage and borrowing a hundred thousand dollars or more on margin to invest in a single real estate investment trust... then take away whatever diversification the trust offered by holding multiple properties. Also, you can't sell any of it until you move away, and the transaction fee will take something like 3%. Still sound \"\"safe\"\"? Moreover, it's exactly the wrong kind of risk. Your house's value is tied to what people are willing to pay for housing where your house is, which is usually subject to the whims of the local economy. This means that in a recession and housing bust in the local economy, you can lose your job and have your mortgage go underwater at the same time. It totally makes sense to treat your house as an investment to some extent, and it makes double sense for a financial adviser to consider it as part of your investment recommendations. \"\"Safety\"\" is not the way you should be thinking of it, though.\""}, {"document_id": "248578-0-1240", "text": "\n\"There are basically two ways to get value out of an appreciating asset such as a home: (a) Sell it and take the profit. In the case of a home, you presumably still have to live somewhere, so unless you buy a cheaper home to replace it, this doesn't get you anywhere. If you can get another house that is just as nice and in just as nice a location -- whatever you consider \"\"nice\"\" to be -- than this sounds like a winning option. If it means moving to a less desirable home, then you are getting the cash but losing the nice home. You'll have to decide if it's worth it. (b) Use it as collateral for a loan. In this case, that means a second mortgage, home equity loan, or a home equity line of credit. But this can be dangerous. House prices are very volatile these days. If the value of the house falls, you could be stuck with debts greater than your assets. In my humble opinion, you should be very careful about doing this. Borrowing against your house to send the kids to college or pay for your spouse's life-saving operation may be reasonable. Borrowing against your house to go on a fancy vacation is almost surely a bad idea. The vacation will be over within a couple of weeks, but you could be paying off the debt for decades.\""}, {"document_id": "475412-0-1412", "text": "\nGift taxes kick in at around $13K per giver per recipient per year. That means that a straight up gift of $200K (as cash or a house) will incur a tax.

I think the children would have to be on the title, since part of the gift money would be theirs (and one is an adult). As far as lending the money, my in-laws are our mortgage lenders, and when we structured the loan, it had to be at a market rate (which could be the lowest advertised rate we found for a fixed-rate mortgage, independent of what we might actually qualify for) or we could not deduct interest payments. Forgiving the loan could also be considered a gift, so they would need to keep an audit trail showing that payments were made, and her father would need to declare the interest income on his taxes. If he bought the house as a second home and let her and her children live there rent-free, it might work, but I'm not sure. It would, in that case, be an asset of his estate when he dies.

It has some interesting information on defaults, it says this: Mortgage holders do sign a promissory note, which is a promise to pay. But the contract explicitly details the penalty for nonpayment \u2014 surrender of the property. The borrower isn\u2019t escaping the consequences; he is suffering them. In some states, lenders also have recourse to the borrowers\u2019 unmortgaged assets, like their car and savings accounts. A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond found that defaults are lower in such states, apparently because lenders threaten the borrowers with judgments against their assets. But actual lawsuits are rare. And given that nearly a quarter of mortgages are underwater, and that 10 percent of mortgages are delinquent, White, of the University of Arizona, is surprised that more people haven\u2019t walked. He thinks the desire to avoid shame is a factor, as are overblown fears of harm to credit ratings. Probably, homeowners also labor under a delusion that their homes will quickly return to value. White has argued that the government should stop perpetuating default \u201cscare stories\u201d and, indeed, should encourage borrowers to default when it\u2019s in their economic interest. This would correct a prevailing imbalance: homeowners operate under a \u201cpowerful moral constraint\u201d while lenders are busily trying to maximize profits.

All things equal, the main advantage of the 30-year loan is that the payment is lower. A completely different argument from what you are hearing is that if you can get a low interest rate, you should get the longest loan possible. It seem unlikely that interest rates are going to get much lower than they are and it's far more likely that they will get higher. In 15 years, if interest rates are back up around 6% or more (where they were when I bought my first home) and you are 15 years into a 30 year mortgage, you'll being enjoying an interest rate that no one can get. You need to keep in mind that as the loan is paid off, you will earn exactly 0% on the principal you've paid. If for some reason the value of the home drops, you lose that portion of the principal. The only way you can get access to that capital is to sell the house. You (generally) can't sell part of the house to send a kid to college. You can take out another mortgage but it is going to be at the current going rate which is likely higher than current rates. Another thing to consider that over the course of 30 years, inflation is going to make a fixed payment cheaper over time. Let's say you make $60K and you have a monthly payment of $1000 or 20% of your annual income. In 15 years at a 1% annualized wage growth rate, it will be 17% of your income. If you get a few raises or inflation jumps up, it will be a lot more than that. For example, at a 2% annualized growth rate, it's only 15% of your income after 15 years. In places where long-term fixed rates are not available, shorter mortgages are common because of the risk of higher rates later. It's also more common to pay them off early for the same reason.

Using the standard 28/36% ratios, a bank will qualify you for 4X your income as a loan. e.g you make $50K, they'll lend you $200K. This is a bit too much in my opinion.  If you come up short, you are really looking to borrow too much, and should probably wait. If you owe a bit on loans, it should squeeze in between those two ratios, 28/36.

The problem is that even if you were to add new credit lines (such as signing up for new credit cards, etc.), they still take time to have a positive effect on your credit.  First, your score takes a bit of a hit with each new hard inquiry by a prospective creditor, then your score will dip slightly when a new credit account is first added. While your credit score will improve somewhat within a few months of adding new credit and you begin to show payment history on those accounts, your average age of accounts needs to be two years or older for the best effect, assuming you're making all of the payments on time. A good happy medium is to have between 7 and 10 credit lines on your credit history, and to make sure it's a mix of account types, such as store cards, installment loans, and credit cards, to show that you can handle various types of credit. Be careful not to add TOO much credit, because it affects your debt-to-income ratio, and that will have a negative effect on your ability to obtain mortgage financing.

Bank Financed Non-FHA loans may have other standards. If you are getting an FHA loan ,if possible put down 20% so that you do not have to pay PMI. That said your PMI costs should be reduced by the size of your down payment since the PMI covers the difference between your equity value (Based on the appraisal at time of purchase) and 20% equity value of the home. So if you buy a home for 425k(assuming 100% appraisal price) 20% equity would be 85k. So if you put 10% down you would be paying PMI until you accrue an addition 42500 in equity. And you will be paying PMI on that for about 12 years(typical on 30 year mortgage) or until you refinance(having home appraised at higher value than purchase price where you would have 20% equity). There are ways to get out of PMI early but few banks are willing to help you through the hoops unless you refinance(and pay more closing costs). 2 - Different banks offer better rates or other benefits for paying points. We paid $300 for a 1.5% reduction in our interest rate (less than 1%) but it was called a point. We were offered a few other points (.25% for 2500 and an one time on demand interest rate adjustment for ~3k) but declined but they may make more sense on a 425k home than our more modest one. You can talk to a banker about this now, get preapproved(which helps with getting offers accepted sometimes), and find out more details about the mortgage they will offer you. This meeting should be free(I would say will but some bank would charge just to prove me wrong) and help answer your questions more authoritatively than anyone here can. 3 - The costs will come out of your down payment. So if you put down 42.5k down your costs will come out of that. So you will probably end up with 30~35k being applied towards your purchase price with the rest going for costs."}, {"document_id": "473692-0-1566", "text": "\nWhat you are suggesting will not work.

You made no mention of the property value but I am assuming if you bought it 3 years ago that you may have a little equity.

Note that for the decision of buying vs. renting a home i.e. for personal use, not for renting out there's a rule of thumb that if the price for buying is more than 20 year's (cold) rents it is considered rather expensive. I don't know how localized this rule of thumb is, but I know it for Germany which is apparently the OP's country, too. There are obviously differences between buying a house/flat for yourself and in order to rent it out. As others have said, maintenance is a major factor for house owners - and here a lot depends on how much of that you do yourself (i.e. do you have the possibility to trade working hours for costs - which is closely related to financial risk exposure, e.g. increasing income by cutting costs as you do maintenance work yourself if you loose your day-time job?). This plays a crucial role for landlords I know (they're all small-scale landlords, and most of them do put in substantial work themselves): I know quite a number of people who rent out flats in the house where they actually live. Some of the houses were built with flats and the owner lives in one of the flats, another rather typical setup is that people built their house in the way that a smaller flat can easily be separated and let once the kids moved out (note also that the legal situation for the landlord is easier in that special case). I also know someone who owns a house several 100 km away from where they live and they say they intentionally ask a rent somewhat below the market price for that (nice) kind of flat so that they have lots of applicants at the same time and tenants don't move out as finding a new tenant is lots of work and costly because of the distance. My personal conclusion from those points is that as an investment (i.e. not for immediate or future personal use) I'd say that the exact circumstances are very important: if you are (stably) based in a region where the buying-to-rental-price ratio is favorable, you have the necessary time and are able to do maintenance work yourself and there is a chance to buy a suitable house closeby then why not."}, {"document_id": "268640-0-1177", "text": "\nThe New York Times has a useful rent-vs-buy calculator.

Also as other answerers said, maintenance costs, closing costs, etc., should be factored in. If renting it out is a possibility even if you move out, it could be a better deal.  One thing to think about renting-wise is, if you move out, where are you likely to move to?  If you move far away, it could be impractical to manage the property as a rental.  You could hire someone else to do that, but that would reduce your income from the rent.  On the other hand, if you stay in LA, it could be feasible to manage the property yourself. Another key factor is, what rent would you be able to charge for this house?  If you can make enough in rent to cover the mortgage payment, you may be in good shape; but due to overpriced real estate markets, sometimes you won't be able to do that, which would mean renting it might not be cost-effective."}, {"document_id": "255414-0-1759", "text": "\nBuying a house may save you money compared with renting, depending on the area and specifics of the transaction (including the purchase price, interest rates, comparable rent, etc.). In addition, buying a house may provide you with intangibles that fit your lifestyle goals (permanence in a community, ability to renovate, pride of ownership, etc.). These factors have been discussed in other answers here and in other questions. However there is one other way I think potential home buyers should consider the financial impact of home ownership: Buying a house provides you with a natural 'hedge' against possible future changes in your cost of living. Assume the following: If these two items are true, then buying a home allows you to guarantee today that your monthly living expenses will be mostly* fixed, as long as you live in that community. In 2 years, if there is an explosion of new residents in your community and housing costs skyrocket - doesn't affect you, your mortgage payment [or if you paid cash, the lack of mortgage payment] is fixed. In 3 years, if there are 20 new apartment buildings built beside you and housing costs plummet - doesn't affect you, your mortgage payment is fixed. If you know that you want to live in a particular place 20 years from now, then buying a house in that area today may be a way of ensuring that you can afford to live there in the future. *Remember that while your mortgage payment will be fixed, other costs of home ownership will be variable.

Have you tried living for a few months putting aside the amount required for not only a mortgage payment but the taxes and insurance on a house/condo in your price range to see if you can really afford it? You can use a real estate website such as trulia to see the assessments of some for sale homes and figure out tax values. The average home insurance in the US is around $900/year if I remember right - more for homes that are more expensive and less for less expensive ones, with flooding and other hazards as a factor. Make sure you can afford to pay for all these items. From a financial perspective realize that you'll always be spending money on your living space. Even if you pay for a house with cash you will be paying property tax and maintenance and would be wise to continue paying for insurance. The value of the house at that point is, as contributor fennec often says, the rent you aren't paying. I personally don't recommend trying to time the market. You can't predict the future - will real estate in your area be a double dip or has it bottomed and is it going up? What you can do is buy a home only when you are sure that you can deal with its relative lack of liquidity by staying there for a long time. Five years is usually a reasonable minimum. There is a way that I recommend figuring out if it is likely bad financial decision to buy, and that's by looking at a financial comparison of renting versus buying. In some cases even with the bursting of the bubble it is still a bad deal to buy. DC went from renting being more cost effective to buying, but San Francisco is one area where buying is still not necessarily the best choice.

The trust is established by a Grantor who \"\"funds\"\" the trust by transferring ownership of items from him or herself (or itself, if another trust or business entity like a corporation) to the trust.  A Trustee is appointed (usually by the Grantor) to manage the trust according to the conditions and terms specified in the trust.

To get the money out, the owner can either distribute a dividend to herself, or sell her stake to another person.

Say, for example, your income now is within the 25% bracket. Any dividend you get will be taxed at that rate, so let's say that the dividend is about 2% and the growth of the stock is about 4%.

See this IRS page: Generally, realized capital losses are first offset against realized capital gains.  Any excess losses can be deducted against ordinary income up to $3,000 ($1,500 if married filing separately) on line 13 of Form 1040.  Losses in excess of this limit can be carried forward to later years to reduce capital gains or ordinary income until the balance of these losses is used up. This means that your harvested losses can be used to offset ordinary income --- up to $3000 in a single year, and with extra losses carried forward to future years.  It is pretty close to a free lunch, provided that you have some losses somewhere in your portfolio. This free lunch is available to anyone, but for a human, it can be quite a chore to decide when to sell what, keep track of the losses, and avoid the wash sale rules.  The advantage of robo-advisors is that they eat that kind of bookkeeping for breakfast, so they can take advantage of tax loss harvesting opportunities that would be too cumbersome for a human to bother with."}, {"document_id": "414636-0-566", "text": "\nIn the US you specify explicitly what stocks you're selling.

Usually, the default is FIFO (i.e.: when you sell, you're assumed to be closing the oldest position), but you can change it if you want.

Instead - here are some points to consider. Short term gains taxed at your marginal rates, whereas long term gains have preferable capital gains rates (up to 20% tax rate, instead of your marginal rate). So if you're selling at gain, you might want to consider to sell FIFO and pay lower capital gains tax rate instead of the short term marginal rate. If you're selling at loss and have other short term gains, you would probably be better selling LIFO, so that the loss could offset other short term gains that you might have.  If you're selling at loss and don't have short term gains to offset, you can still offset your long term gains with short term losses, but the tax benefit will be lower.

You will use mirrors to move the laser and avoid obstacles to get the data back to Earth. Each level has new challenges and your ultimate goal is to build a communication network and synchronize, or match, the time on atomic clocks.\n\nAbout the mission\nOptical communication uses lasers to send data with a type of light that we can\u2019t see, called infrared light. Since the 1950s, NASA missions have used a different type of waves, called radio waves, to send data to and from space. With current radio wave communications, it takes about nine weeks to send a complete map of Mars back to Earth. With lasers, it only takes about nine days!\nOptical communication is very useful for space missions because data can be sent faster and more securely. Optical communication systems are also smaller, weigh less, and use less power. A smaller size means more room for science instruments, and using less power means less of a drain of the spacecraft\u2019s batteries. These are all very important details for NASA when designing and creating mission concepts.

Before getting started, read on to learn about some of the current and future NASA missions exploring the same destinations you will soon encounter with your fleet of spacecraft. NASA\u2019s Artemis program calls for sending the first woman and next man to the surface of the Moon by 2024. It also seeks to establish a permanent and sustainable presence on the Moon. The agency will use what we learn on the Moon to prepare for humanity's next giant leap \u2013 sending astronauts to Mars.On Mars, Perseverance, NASA's most advanced Mars rover to date, is taking the next steps in our exploration of the Red Planet. Only the fifth NASA rover to land on Mars, Perseverance is building on the work and scientific discoveries of its predecessors by searching for evidence of ancient microbial life on the Red Planet.In the near future, NASA plans to take its search for life even farther into the solar system to Jupiter's ocean moon Europa. This small moon contains more water beneath its icy shell than all of Earth's oceans combined. NASA's Europa Clipper mission, currently in development, is designed to orbit Europa, make up-close observations, and investigate whether the icy moon has conditions suitable for life.About the image: From left to right: An artistic depiction of the Artemis program's Gateway space station; a selfie taken by the Perseverance rover on Mars; and an artistic depiction of the Europa Clipper spacecraft orbiting Jupiter's moon Europa.

It is vital for healthy aging and can reduce the burden of chronic diseases and prevent early death. Yet, only about 1 in 4 adults and 1 in 6 high school students fully meet the recommendations in the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.\nAccess to safe places to play and walk, such as parks, safe streets, trails, and greenways, is important for physical activity. It is also important to be able to safely and easily walk, bike, or take transit to everyday destinations such as homes, workplaces, schools, parks, health care, and food outlets.\nAdditionally, many people from racial and ethnic minority groups and from rural areas are less likely to have access to these safe spaces. Historical land use as well as housing and transportation policies can contribute to limited access. People impacted by these disparities are also less likely to meet the physical activity recommendations.\nDesigning communities to provide access to these safe spaces for everyone helps increase physical activity and can provide better places to live. It can also help improve health equity.\nConnect activity-friendly routes to everyday destinations\nTip\u200e\nImplement policies and activities to connect pedestrian, bicycle, or transit transportation networks (called activity-friendly routes) to everyday destinations.To align with the Community Preventive Services Task Force's built environment recommendation, increasing physical activity through community design needs to include at least one element from activity-friendly routes plus one element from everyday destinations. Possibilities for each are below.\nSee recommendation\n\nActivity-Friendly Routes\n\nEveryday Destinations\n\nThese may include new or improved:\r\n\nStreet pattern design and connectivity, such as convenient, connected, and accessible streets that create many route options, shorter block lengths, and shorter crossing distances.", "title": "Strategies for Physical Activity Through Community Design | Physical Activity | CDC"}, {"document_id": "5a0620324a34660c-3131-4885", "text": "\r\n\tSwimming - NYS Parks, Recreation & Historic Preservation\r\n\nRed flags indicate a danger or hazard.

Neon pink and neon orange offer the most visibility for light-bottomed pools. For lakes and dark-bottomed pools, neon green, neon orange and neon yellow are the most visible.\nConsider learning CPR. In an emergency, every second counts.\n\nBe aware of the conditions. \r\n\t\nOcean swimming is very different from pool swimming, so be prepared for powerful waves, strong surf and sudden drop-offs. \nRip currents usually form near a shallow point in the water, and can happen at any beach with breaking waves, including the Great Lakes. If you are caught in a rip current, try to remain calm and\r\n\tdon't fight it. Swim parallel to the shore until you are out of the current, and float or tread water if you begin to tire. More from the National Weather Service: Break the Grip of the Rip! \nKeep away from the water's edge. Jagged, slippery rocks and murky waters can be hazardous.\n\nBe aware of the rules.\r\n\t\nSwim only in designated areas, and only when a lifeguard is on duty. Prohibited swim areas are often accompanied by dangers such as turbulent underwater currents, extreme cold, and widely varying depths. \r\n\tThese hazards can put even good swimmers at risk.\nChoose a swimming spot near a lifeguard for maximum visibility. Always follow their directions, and ensure that any children you are swimming with do the same.\nWatch for warning flags and know what they mean. Green flags usually mark designated swimming areas - be sure to swim between the green flags. Yellow flags may denote a surfing beach or an advisory. \r\n\tRed flags indicate a danger or hazard. Flag designations may vary, so be sure to understand the color coding before you dive in.\n\nBe attentive.\r\n\t\nAlways swim sober.\nIf you're swimming with children, designate a \"water watcher\" who will always keep a close eye on the kids.

Many more couples , however , experience involuntary childlessness for at least one year : estimates range from 12 % to 28 % .

A couple that tries unsuccessfully to have a child after a certain period of time ( often a short period , but definitions vary ) is sometimes said to be subfertile , meaning less fertile than a typical couple .

At best, spam is annoying. At worst, it\u2019s pushing scams or trying to install malware on your device. If you\u2019re tired of getting spam, there are some ways to help.When scammers send\u00a0spammy messages that seem legit (but aren\u2019t), they\u2019re often trying to trick you into clicking links and giving them\u00a0personal or financial information. Things like your passwords or bank account and Social Security numbers are valuable to scammers. With that access to your accounts, scammers could try to steal your money or\u00a0your identity. Or both.To help you cut down on spam and avoid scams:Use filters. Your mobile phone probably has options to\u00a0filter and block texts from unknown senders. Some wireless providers and call blocking apps can also help block unwanted messages. Many popular email providers (like Gmail) have strong\u00a0spam filters turned on by default. But if any spam gets into your inbox, mark it as\u00a0spam or junk.Protect your personal information. Before you enter personal information on a website, email, or text chain, stop. Ask yourself: Why do they need this information? And what\u2019s going to happen to it?

However, there are a few things you need to consider that you haven't yet thought about. First, it is important to remember that trading with fake money is not the same as trading with real money. In the fake world, you have $100k. With this fake money, you can do reckless things with it, such as put it all on one stock. If you lose, it costs you nothing, so you don't have an emotional attachment to it. With real money, it will feel different, and that is something you haven't experienced yet. Second, you mentioned that you are good at making picks. With all due respect, I suggest that you aren't old enough to make that determination. You haven't been trading for long enough to determine if you are doing well at it. :) That having been said, I don't want to completely discourage you from trying something new. Third, you mentioned long-term investing, but you also said that you need to make your money back quick and mentioned trading daily. Those things aren't really compatible. I wouldn't consider what you are doing as long-term investing. With the type of investing you are doing, picking individual stocks and hoping for the value to go up in a relatively short time-frame, it is similar to gambling. The risk of losing is very much there, and you shouldn't be investing money this way that you aren't prepared to lose. If you need the money for something soon, don't put it in the stock market. Never forget this. What can happen is that you start with small amounts of money, do well, and then, thinking that you are good at this, put in larger amounts of money. You will eventually lose. If you put in money that you need for something else, you have a problem. If you are trying this out for education and entertainment purposes, that is great. But when it starts to get serious, make sure that you are aware of the risks. Educate yourself and be smart."}, {"document_id": "193404-0-781", "text": "\nPump-and-dump scams are indeed very real, but the scale of a single scam isn't anywhere near the type of heist you see in movies like Trading Places. Usually, the scammer will buy a few hundred dollars of a penny stock for some obscure small business, then they'll spam every address they have with advice that this business is about to announce a huge breakthrough that will make it the next Microsoft. A few dozen people bite, buy up a few thousand shares each (remember the shares are trading for pennies), then when the rise in demand pushes up the price enough for the scammer to make a decent buck, he cashes out, the price falls based on the resulting glut of stock, and the victims lose their money. Thus a few red flags shake out that would-be investors should be wary of:"}, {"document_id": "367845-0-365", "text": "\nStock market is like poker: you don't take the same risks when it is fake money and thus you don't learn the same lessons from your mistakes. I would recommend instead to play with real market and real money (rule #0: use only money that you don't need). Start with safe products and go to the bath progressively. It took me about ten years and I am still learning."}, {"document_id": "464297-0-2239", "text": "\nIf you have money and may need to access it at any time, you should put it in a savings account. It won't return much interest, but it will return some and it is easily accessible. If you have all your emergency savings that you need (at least six months of income), buy index-based mutual funds. These should invest in a broad range of securities including both stocks and bonds (three dollars in stocks for every dollar in bonds) so as to be robust in the face of market shifts. You should not buy individual stocks unless you have enough money to buy a lot of them in different industries. Thirty different stocks is a minimum for a diversified portfolio, and you really should be looking at more like a hundred. There's also considerable research effort required to verify that the stocks are good buys. For most people, this is too much work. For most people, broad-based index funds are better purchases. You don't have as much upside, but you also are much less likely to find yourself holding worthless paper. If you do buy stocks, look for ones where you know something about them. For example, if you've been to a restaurant chain with a recent IPO that really wowed you with their food and service, consider investing. But do your research, so that you don't get caught buying after everyone else has already overbid the price. The time to buy is right before everyone else notices how great they are, not after. Some people benefit from joining investment clubs with others with similar incomes and goals. That way you can share some of the research duties. Also, you can get other opinions before buying, which can restrain risky impulse buys. Just to reiterate, I would recommend sticking to mutual funds and saving accounts for most investors. Only make the move into individual stocks if you're willing to be serious about it. There's considerable work involved. And don't forget diversification. You want to have stocks that benefit regardless of what the overall economy does. Some stocks should benefit from lower oil prices while others benefit from higher prices. You want to have both types so as not to be caught flat-footed when prices move. There are much more experienced people trying to guess market directions."}, {"document_id": "129070-0-336", "text": "\nYou could use a stock-only ISA and invest in Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).

Choosing and investing in only one stock is risky.  You can lower your risk by diversifying, or investing in lots of different stocks.  However, you have some problems with this:  When you buy stocks directly, you have to buy whole shares, and you don't have enough money to buy even one whole share of all the stocks you want to invest in. You aren't even sure which stocks you should buy. A mutual fund solves both of these problems.  You get together with other investors and pool your money together to buy a group of stocks.  That way, your investment is diversified in lots of different stocks without having to have enough money to buy whole shares of each one.  And the mutual fund has a manager that chooses which stocks the fund will invest in, so you don't have to pick. There are lots of mutual funds to choose from, with as many different objectives as you can imagine.  Some invest in large companies, others small; some invest in a certain sector of companies (utilities or health care, for example), some invest in stocks that pay a dividend, others are focused on growth.  Some funds don't invest in stocks at all; they might invest in bonds, real estate, or precious metals.  Some funds are actively managed, where the manager actively buys and sells different stocks in the fund continuously (and takes a fee for his services), and others simply invest in a list of stocks and rarely buy or sell (these are called index funds). To answer your question, yes, the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Equity Fund is a mutual fund.  It is an actively-managed stock mutual fund that attempts to invest in growing companies that do business in countries with rapidly developing economies."}, {"document_id": "407571-0-677", "text": "\n\"Okay.

It allows you to gain exposure to a sector without having to buy individual companies.  There are ETFs for lots of different things.

On the other hand they are often proposed as a simple way to   invest private funds for people that do not want to always keep an eye   on the market, hence the intraday trading is mostly irrelevant for   them. I am pretty sure that this is a subjective idea. The fact is you may buy GOOG, AAPL, F or whatever you wish(ETF as well, such as QQQ, SPY etc.) and keep them for a long time. In both cases, if you do not want to keep an on the market it is ok. Because, if you keep them it is called investment(the idea is collecting dividends etc.), if you are day trading then is it called speculation, because you main goal is to earn by buying and selling, of course you may loose as well. So, you do not care about dividends or owning some percent of the company. As, ETFs are derived instruments, their volatility depends on the volatility of the related shares. I'm wondering whether there are secondary effects that make the   liquidity argument interesting for private investors, despite not   using it themselves. What would these effects be and how do they   impact when compared, for example, to mutual funds? Liquidity(ability to turn cash) could create high volatility which means high risk and high reward. From this point of view mutual funds are more safe.

Frankly, if you will need the money in one year I wouldn't touch anything riskier than a money market account. $5000 also isn't enough to give you much flexibility in achieving a balanced portfolio, since the minimal initial purchase for mutual funds is often around $2500. (I'm not sure whether ETFs would give you any more flexibility.) So on grounds of both size and time horizon, I have to recommend against this plan. The risk of losing money, with insufficient time for gains to balance that risk, is simply too high. Others may feel differently, of course.

You don't open a mutual fund, you invest in it. There's a minimum required investment ($2000? Could be, some funds have lower limits, you don't have to go with the Fidelity one necessarily), but in general it has nothing to do with your Roth IRA account. You can invest in mutual funds with any trading account, not just Roth IRA (or any other specific kind). If you invest in ETF's  - you can invest in funds just as well (subject to the minimums set). As to the plan itself - buying and selling ETF's will cost you commission, ~2-3% of your investment. Over several months, you may get positive returns, and may get negative returns, but keep in mind that you start with the 2-3% loss on day 1. Within a short period of time, especially in the current economic climate (which is very unstable - just out of recession, election year, etc etc), I would think that keeping the cash in a savings account would be a better choice. While with ETF you don't have any guarantees other than -3%, then with savings accounts you can at least have a guaranteed return of ~1% APY (i.e.: won't earn much over the course of your internship, but you'll keep your money safe for your long term investment). For the long term - the fluctuations of month to month don't matter much, so investing now for the next 50 years - you shouldn't care about the stock market going 10% in April. So, keep your 1000 in savings account, and if you want to invest 5000 in your Roth IRA - invest it then.

For someone on a smaller budget, many low cost brokers (ETrade as mentioned by Litteadv, Scottrade as mentioned by myself in another similar question today) allow you to start with smaller initial balances and have a small selection of funds or ETF's that you can trade from without commission.  In the case of Scottrade, they have like 15 ETF's that you can trade comission free.  Check with the various low cost brokerages such as ETrade, Scottrade, and TDAmeritrade, to see what their policies are, and what if any funds/ETF's they allow you to trade in without commissions.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Container Registry benefits\n\n Benefit Description \n\n Highly available and scalable private registry."}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07949-12261-14447", "text": "\nCombined with an intuitive user experience, built-in security and isolation, and advanced tools to secure, manage, and monitor your cluster workloads, you can rapidly deliver highly available and secure containerized apps in the public cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Container Registry \n\nUse [Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview) to store and access private container images. Container Registry provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. This service is required if using Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Storage \n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Object Storage \n\n[Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage) stores encrypted and dispersed data across multiple geographic locations. Object Storage is available with three types of resiliency: Cross Region, Regional, and Single Data Center. Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata. Finally, objects are defined by a globally unique combination of the bucket name and the object key, or name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Security \n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services \n\n[Hyper Protect Crypto Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-overview) is a dedicated key management service and hardware security module (HSM) based on IBM Cloud."}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01388-1400-3142", "text": "\nYou can choose to create a second IBM Cloud account, or you can work with a colleague that has an IBM Cloud account.\n* Ensure that you have the correct access permissions for adding and removingnamespaces, see [Access roles for configuring IBM Cloud Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-iamaccess_roles_configure).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 1: Authorize a user to configure the registry \n\nAdd a second user to your account and grant them the ability to configure IBM Cloud Container Registry.\n\n\n\n1.

All containers that make up your microservice are grouped into pods, a logical unit to ensure easy management and discovery. These pods run on compute hosts that are managed in a Kubernetes cluster that is portable, extensible, and self-healing in case of failures.\n\nFor more information about Kubernetes, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/?path=users&persona=app-developer<=vel=foundational).\n\n\n\n\n\n How does IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service work? \n\nWith IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, you can create your own Kubernetes cluster to deploy and manage containerized apps on IBM Cloud.

Your resource usage consists of recurring and fluctuating costs. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads. You pay only for what you use or commit to on a monthly basis, with no long-term contracts. Usage consists of products, services, and resources.\n\nWith Subscription accounts, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For more information about the differences between account types, see [Account types](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-accounts).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens if my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota? \n\nWhen you reach any quota for Lite plan instances, the service for that month is suspended.

In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged. \n Tiered In this pricing model, you get a volumed-based discount according to your actual usage. Tiered pricing is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. Services For API Connect, one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter. \n Reserved Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. Services Db2 on Cloud has reserved plans. \n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding monthly and hourly tags \n\nOn the usage dashboard, your products and resources can be labeled with Monthly, Hourly, or a combination of both tags to signify how often charges are updated.\n\nThe Monthly tag signifies that resources within your account have a fixed cost. These charge show up immediately after purchase and are prorated in proportion to how many days are left in the month. Any recurring monthly fixed costs are then shown at the first of every month.\n\nThe Hourly tag signifies that resources within your account have variable costs. These resources are updated daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n Lite plans \n\nLite plans are structured as a free quota. You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03729-4932-7001", "text": "\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances. Usage of services that aren't included as part of the free allowance is charged in one of the following ways:\n\nFixed charges\n: You select a plan and pay on a flat rate basis. For example, the Bare Metal Servers are charged at a flat-rate.\n\nMetered charges\n: You pay based on your runtime and service consumption. For example, with the Push service, any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n\nReserved charges\n: As the account owner of a Pay As You Go account or a Subscription account, you can reserve a service instance, with a long-term commitment, for a discounted price. For example, you can reserve the standard large Db2 on Cloud offering for 12 months.\n: Some IBM Cloud services offer reserved plans. You can request a reserved plan from the IBM Cloud catalog by clicking the tile of the service. Then, select the service plan that best meets your needs. If a reserved plan is available, click Request, and follow the prompts to send your request. You receive an email that contains the price information of the reserved plan. An IBM Cloud sales representative also contacts you soon to complete the purchase.\n\nTiered charges\n: Similar to metered charges, you pay based on your runtime and service consumption. However, tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\n\n\n Simple tier \n\nIn the simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into. The total price is your quantity that is multiplied by the unit price in that tier, for example:\n\n\n\nTable 2.

The question about what is a better investment is subjective, something you invest in has the ability to grow in value. So examples of investments would be buying stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. When it comes down to it, long-term investments pay better than short-term ones.

IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service is a managed Kubernetes offering that provides powerful tools, an intuitive user experience, and built-in security for rapid delivery of apps that you can bind to cloud services related to IBM Watson, AI, IoT, DevOps, security, and data analytics. It offers features like intelligent scheduling, self-healing, horizontal scaling, service discovery and load balancing, automated rollouts and rollbacks, and secret and configuration management.

As for access policies, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service uses Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) to grant access to cluster resources through IAM platform access roles and Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) policies through IAM service access roles. The access policies that you assign users depend on what you want your users to be able to do.

Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. An example of this type of charge is the fixed plans for Bare Metal Servers.\n2. Metered: Metered usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. An example of this type of charge is the Push service, where any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n3. Tiered: Tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block. In the simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into. The total price is your quantity that is multiplied by the unit price in that tier. An example of this type of charge is the API Connect service, where one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter.\n4. Reserved: Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. An example of this type of charge is the Db2 on Cloud service, which has reserved plans.", "annotations": {"RougeL": {"system": {"value": 1.0}}, "Bert-Rec": {"system": {"value": 0.9999998807907101}}, "Bert-KPrec": {"system": {"value": 0.47806492447853005}}, "naturalness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1727957978.0, "duration": 1656.0, "value": "4"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728353017.0, "duration": 623.0, "value": "4"}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728392391.0, "duration": 2510.0, "value": "4"}}, "appropriateness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1727957978.0, "duration": 1656.0, "value": "4"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728353017.0, "duration": 623.0, "value": "4"}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728392391.0, "duration": 2510.0, "value": "3"}}, "completeness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1727957978.0, "duration": 1656.0, "value": "4"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728353017.0, "duration": 623.0, "value": "4"}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728392391.0, "duration": 2510.0, "value": "4"}}, "faithfulness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1727957978.0, "duration": 1656.0, "value": "4"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728353017.0, "duration": 623.0, "value": "4"}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728392391.0, "duration": 2510.0, "value": "4"}}, "win-rate": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1727957978.0, "duration": 1656.0, "value": 0.0}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728353017.0, "duration": 623.0, "value": 100.0}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728392391.0, "duration": 2510.0, "value": 100.0}}, "conditional_idk": {"composite": {"value": 1}}, "rl_f": {"composite": {"value": 1.0}}, "rb_llm": {"composite": {"value": 1.0}}, "rb_agg": {"composite": {"value": 0.8946889669460557}}}}, {"task_id": "adf9b1f61c73d715809bc7b37ac02724<::>5", "model_id": "reference", "model_response": "To update your pricing plan: First, navigate to the IBM Cloud console, go to the Resource List, and select the service.

The goal of spousal support is to provide financial assistance to the lower-earning spouse to help them maintain a similar standard of living after the divorce.", "annotations": {"RougeL": {"system": {"value": 0.310756972111553}}, "Bert-Rec": {"system": {"value": 0.21230959892272902}}, "Bert-KPrec": {"system": {"value": 0.24598757922649303}}, "naturalness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728560995.0, "duration": 618.0, "value": "4"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728613806.0, "duration": 153.0, "value": "4"}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728901369.0, "duration": 1964.0, "value": "3"}}, "appropriateness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728560995.0, "duration": 618.0, "value": "3"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728613806.0, "duration": 153.0, "value": "4"}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728901369.0, "duration": 1964.0, "value": "3"}}, "completeness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728560995.0, "duration": 618.0, "value": "4"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728613806.0, "duration": 153.0, "value": "4"}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728901369.0, "duration": 1964.0, "value": "3"}}, "faithfulness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728560995.0, "duration": 618.0, "value": "2"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728613806.0, "duration": 153.0, "value": "3"}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728901369.0, "duration": 1964.0, "value": "3"}}, "win-rate": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728560995.0, "duration": 618.0, "value": 50.0}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728613806.0, "duration": 153.0, "value": 0.0}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728901369.0, "duration": 1964.0, "value": 0.0}}, "conditional_idk": {"composite": {"value": 1}}, "rl_f": {"composite": {"value": 0.5}}, "rb_llm": {"composite": {"value": 0.7}}, "rb_agg": {"composite": {"value": 0.4634747339203838}}}}, {"task_id": "ca6f0197d2c0c4d6e3be090c3f8bf30f<::>1", "model_id": "llama-3.1-405b-instruct", "model_response": "Based on the provided documents, the decision to pay off a car loan entirely or leave $1 until the end of the loan period depends on your financial goals.

A Query uses Discovery Query Language syntax to define the search criteria, while an NLQ accepts a text string value to find answers to queries written in natural language.\n\nIn general, a query typically consists of the following elements:\n\n1. A request to retrieve specific data or information\n2. A set of criteria or conditions that the data must meet\n3. A specific format or structure for the data to be returned\n\nQueries can be used to perform various operations, such as:\n\n* Retrieving specific data or documents\n* Filtering data based on certain criteria\n* Aggregating data to perform calculations or summaries\n* Sorting or ranking data based on specific criteria\n\nOverall, queries are a powerful tool for extracting insights and information from large datasets, and are a fundamental component of many data-driven applications and systems.", "annotations": {"RougeL": {"system": {"value": 0.19736842105263103}}, "Bert-Rec": {"system": {"value": 0.50331562757492}}, "Bert-KPrec": {"system": {"value": 0.20553952455520602}}, "naturalness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728380486.0, "duration": 1929.0, "value": "3"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728449837.0, "duration": 360.0, "value": "2"}, "46373812": {"timestamp": 1728478447.0, "duration": 2172.0, "value": "3"}}, "appropriateness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728380486.0, "duration": 1929.0, "value": "3"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728449837.0, "duration": 360.0, "value": "2"}, "46373812": {"timestamp": 1728478447.0, "duration": 2172.0, "value": "3"}}, "completeness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728380486.0, "duration": 1929.0, "value": "4"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728449837.0, "duration": 360.0, "value": "4"}, "46373812": {"timestamp": 1728478447.0, "duration": 2172.0, "value": "4"}}, "faithfulness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728380486.0, "duration": 1929.0, "value": "3"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728449837.0, "duration": 360.0, "value": "4"}, "46373812": {"timestamp": 1728478447.0, "duration": 2172.0, "value": "2"}}, "win-rate": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728380486.0, "duration": 1929.0, "value": 0.0}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728449837.0, "duration": 360.0, "value": 50.0}, "46373812": {"timestamp": 1728478447.0, "duration": 2172.0, "value": 50.0}}, "conditional_idk": {"composite": {"value": 1}}, "rl_f": {"composite": {"value": 0.9375}}, "rb_llm": {"composite": {"value": 0.7}}, "rb_agg": {"composite": {"value": 0.3723901265293913}}}}, {"task_id": "1c041ce47a81941c26899fdf08bde961<::>3", "model_id": "llama-3.1-405b-instruct", "model_response": "To improve your query results, you can take the following actions:\n\n1.

Here's an example of how to use IBM Cloudant Query:\n\n1. Create a query: You can create a query using the Cloudant Query API or the Cloudant dashboard.\n2. Define the query: Define the query using the Cloudant Query syntax. For example, to retrieve all documents where the \"name\" field is \"John\", you can use the following query:\n\n```\n{\n  \"selector\": {\n    \"name\": \"John\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. Run the query: Run the query using the Cloudant Query API or the Cloudant dashboard.\n4. Retrieve the results: The query will return a list of documents that match the query criteria.\n\nSome common Cloudant Query operators include:\n\n* `selector`: Specifies the fields to query.\n* `fields`: Specifies the fields to include in the result.\n* `sort`: Specifies the sort order of the result.\n* `limit`: Specifies the maximum number of documents to return.\n* `skip`: Specifies the number of documents to skip before returning results.\n\nSome common Cloudant Query examples include:\n\n* Retrieve all documents where the \"name\" field is \"John\":\n\n```\n{\n  \"selector\": {\n    \"name\": \"John\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* Retrieve all documents where the \"age\" field is greater than 30:\n\n```\n{\n  \"selector\": {\n    \"age\": {\n      \"$gt\": 30\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* Retrieve all documents where the \"name\" field is \"John\" and the \"age\" field is greater than 30:\n\n```\n{\n  \"selector\": {\n    \"name\": \"John\",\n    \"age\": {\n      \"$gt\": 30\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote: The `$gt` operator is used to specify a greater-than condition.

Investing in individual stocks is only recommended if you have enough money to buy a diversified portfolio (at least 30 different stocks) and are willing to put in the considerable research effort required to verify that the stocks are good buys.", "annotations": {"RougeL": {"system": {"value": 0.24742268041237103}}, "Bert-Rec": {"system": {"value": 0.409908801317214}}, "Bert-KPrec": {"system": {"value": 0.397068232297897}}, "naturalness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728472015.0, "duration": 1774.0, "value": "3"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728521388.0, "duration": 859.0, "value": "2"}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728561469.0, "duration": 767.0, "value": "4"}}, "appropriateness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728472015.0, "duration": 1774.0, "value": "4"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728521388.0, "duration": 859.0, "value": "4"}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728561469.0, "duration": 767.0, "value": "4"}}, "completeness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728472015.0, "duration": 1774.0, "value": "4"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728521388.0, "duration": 859.0, "value": "4"}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728561469.0, "duration": 767.0, "value": "3"}}, "faithfulness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728472015.0, "duration": 1774.0, "value": "4"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728521388.0, "duration": 859.0, "value": "2"}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728561469.0, "duration": 767.0, "value": "4"}}, "win-rate": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728472015.0, "duration": 1774.0, "value": 0.0}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728521388.0, "duration": 859.0, "value": 0.0}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728561469.0, "duration": 767.0, "value": 50.0}}, "conditional_idk": {"composite": {"value": 1}}, "rl_f": {"composite": {"value": 1.0}}, "rb_llm": {"composite": {"value": 0.9}}, "rb_agg": {"composite": {"value": 0.4353019782322661}}}}, {"task_id": "61374b240d5742f957706d00f9ed0dd6<::>3", "model_id": "llama-3.1-405b-instruct", "model_response": "An ETF, or Exchange Traded Fund, is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund.

You pay a flat rate for a specific resource or service, regardless of usage. For example, Bare Metal Servers have fixed plans that are charged at a fixed monthly rate.\n\n2. **Metered**: Metered usage is a unit-based pricing model where you pay for what you consume. You're charged based on the actual usage of a resource or service, such as the number of GB-hours consumed for runtimes or the number of IP addresses and storage consumed for containers.\n\n3. **Tiered**: Tiered pricing offers volume-based discounts according to your actual usage. You pay a lower rate as your usage increases. Tiered pricing is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. For example, API Connect has a tiered plan that charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter.\n\n4. **Reserved**: Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, which allows you to get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment.

ETFs trade like stocks, so you only need enough to buy at least one share and cover trading commissions, though some brokerages may offer commission-free trading for certain ETFs.\n\nConsider starting with a low-cost brokerage like ETrade, Scottrade, or TDAmeritrade, which may offer commission-free options.", "annotations": {"RougeL": {"system": {"value": 0.215139442231075}}, "Bert-Rec": {"system": {"value": 0.10330384969711301}}, "Bert-KPrec": {"system": {"value": 0.19030070304870603}}, "naturalness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728464830.0, "duration": 1639.0, "value": "3"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728518811.0, "duration": 827.0, "value": "4"}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728557101.0, "duration": 3805.0, "value": "3"}}, "appropriateness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728464830.0, "duration": 1639.0, "value": "3"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728518811.0, "duration": 827.0, "value": "3"}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728557101.0, "duration": 3805.0, "value": "3"}}, "completeness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728464830.0, "duration": 1639.0, "value": "4"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728518811.0, "duration": 827.0, "value": "4"}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728557101.0, "duration": 3805.0, "value": "3"}}, "faithfulness": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728464830.0, "duration": 1639.0, "value": "4"}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728518811.0, "duration": 827.0, "value": "2"}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728557101.0, "duration": 3805.0, "value": "4"}}, "win-rate": {"46542882": {"timestamp": 1728464830.0, "duration": 1639.0, "value": 0.0}, "47200615": {"timestamp": 1728518811.0, "duration": 827.0, "value": 50.0}, "46544861": {"timestamp": 1728557101.0, "duration": 3805.0, "value": 0.0}}, "conditional_idk": {"composite": {"value": 1}}, "rl_f": {"composite": {"value": 1.0}}, "rb_llm": {"composite": {"value": 0.6}}, "rb_agg": {"composite": {"value": 0.36849907317016806}}}}, {"task_id": "61374b240d5742f957706d00f9ed0dd6<::>5", "model_id": "gpt-4o", "model_response": "Long-term investing typically refers to a time horizon of 10 years or more.
